2.Features: Allows increasing or decreasing the total supply and balances through minting and burning.

3.Tech Stack: Uses Solidity for the contract, Web3.js for blockchain interaction, and HDWalletProvider for wallet management.

4.Deployment: deploy.js compiles and deploys the contract, logging the address.

5.Interaction: interact.js enables token minting, burning, and balance checks on the deployed contract.
